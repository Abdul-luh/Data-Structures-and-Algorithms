Algorithm Analysis
There are multiple ways to solve a problem
example: there are multiple ways to sort a list of numbers
-How do we analyse which one of them is the most efficient?

Factor that affect run time of an algorithm
- Programming Language Used
- computer the program runs on 
- other programs running at the same time 
- Quality of the operating system
etc

We evaluate the performance of an algorithm in terms of  its input size

Time complexcity - amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size
space complexcity - amount of space taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size

How to represent complexcity
Asymptotic Notation are 
- Mathemeatical tools are used to represent time complexity

types of Asymptotic Notation
1. Big-O Notation(O-notation) - worse case complexcity
2. Omega Notation (Ω-notation) - best cast complexity
3. Theta Notation(θ-notation)  - Average case complexcity
