Recursion
what is Recursion? 
Recursion is a problem solving technique where the solution depends on smaller instaces of the same problem

Technically this is when a fuction calls it's self

Why is is needed
the technique is used to simplfy your solution
If you find yourself breaking down your problem into smaller version of the same problem Recursion is very useful

Analogy
when we ask what the total number of students in a school is 

                            Principal
                ---------------|-----------------
                |                               |
            Professor A                     Professor B
        -------|---------                   ------|---------
    Teacher A           Teacher B       Teacher C           Teacher D
    50                     50               45                   55 


    Few Points About Recursion
* Every recursive solutions needs to have a base case - a condition to terminate the Recursion
* recursive solutions simplfy solving a problem but it does not always translate to a faster solution. A recursion may be far worse compared to an iterative solution 
* it is not a topic that is most staight foward to understand. Do not give up if you struggle with the concept
