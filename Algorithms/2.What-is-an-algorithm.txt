An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem

// example

Ingredients -> Recipe -> Tasty Dish

// cooking noodles

cup of noodles      1. Boil Water                   
Taste Maker     ->  2. pour water into cup      ->  Tasty noodles
water               3. Add taste Maker
                    4. close lid and wait 
                    
algorithms are is the same order
Input -> algorithm -> Output


    <Programming>
Algorithm to add two numbers

Remember!
Input -> algorithm -> Output

in this case
Input       ->  algorithm               ->  Output
    |               |                           |
Two numbers     1. Add numbers using +      sum of a and b
a and b         2. return the value


    CHARACTERISTICS OF AN ALGORITHM
1. Well defined inputs and outputs
2. Each Step should b e clear and unambiguous
3. Language independent


Why should your learn about algorithms

1. Solving problems as a developer
2. learning different techniques to efficiently sovling a problem
3. one problem can be solved in many different ways using differen algorithms
4. Every allgorithm comes with its own tradeoffs when it comes to performance.
