// SORTING ALGORITHMS

/**
    Sorting algorithms are very important in web development
    the four Sorting algorithms we'll be working on in this course are:
    >> Bubble Sort
    >> Insertion Sort
    >> Quick Sort
    >> Merge Sort

    Other Types of sorting includes:

    >> Tim Sort
    >> Cycle Sort
    >> Comb Sort
    >> Gnome Sort
    >> Pancake Sort
    >> Pigeonhole Sort

    THE APPROACH
    
    - Problem Statement
    - pause the video and try solve the problem
    - implement the solution together
    - Determine the Big-O
